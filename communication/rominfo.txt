READ STATUS REGISTER or FLAG STATUS REGISTER Command

For quad SPI protocol, the command code is input on DQ[3:0], and is output on DQ[3:0].
The operation is terminated by driving S# HIGH at any time during data output

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WRITE VOLATILE or ENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER Command

the WRITE ENABLE command must be executed to set the write enable latch bit to 1. S# is driven LOW and held LOW
until the eighth bit of the last data byte has been latched in, after which it must be driven HIGH
 
For quad SPI protocol, the command code is input on DQ[3:0], followed by the data bytes

Because register bits are volatile, change to the bits is immediate. If S# is not drivenHIGH, the command is not executed,
flag status register error bits are not set, and the write enable latch remains set to 1.
Reserved bits are not affected by this command.
